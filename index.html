            <p class="text-faded">Enthusiasm, growth, adaptability, and flexibility have 
              been the drivers behind the success in my career. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded"> 
                When I was 9 years old I walked downstairs to our basement where my brother was flipping through a book about 5” thick titled HTML. I thought it was awesome that you could create something from nothing and make it look cool on the monitor in front of you. I made some basic “apps” with some headers and some paragraphs - that was the extent and my introduction to coding. In college I started some Code Academy courses, but was full-throttle engaged in my English degree, so those fell by the wayside.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded"> 
                The real motivator that got me seriously interested in coding again was a warm fall day in Cedar Hills, Utah. I was at a client’s house spraying down a giant gardening-bed retaining wall scrubbing down the year-old cured concrete trying to remove the streaks that had layered to the surface. My brain hurt. There was a lack of engagement for it. I’ve spent most of my life engaged in stimulating activities that challenged my brain and body - I need that...a challenge. WIthout a challenge, I tend to get restless. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded"> 
                Enter web development as a serious consideration for my next career. It had everything I needed: problem solving, creativity, complex interactions, and never-ending growth. Critical analysis boosted my syntax-debugging skills. My ability to adapt to new industries and new job requirements increased my ability to learn and integrate into coding faster. Playing a college sport taught me how to work with and contribute effectively to a team. Working with a high-producing sales agent taught me efficiency and thoroughness. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded"> 
                
I look forward to the many new and exciting challenges and opportunities software development has to offer me.

              to capture user information as well as a payment
